## About ASHRAE Terminology
ASHRAE Terminology, a free resource, is a comprehensive online glossary of more than 3700 terms and definitions related to the built environment, with a focus on heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC), as well as refrigeration, building envelope, electrical, lighting, water and energy use, and measurement terms.

This searchable glossary was designed for use by engineering professionals but is also useful for architects, building owners and operators, educators, public officials, and homeowners.

The terms in ASHRAE Terminology have been assembled and defined and are updated on an ongoing basis by ASHRAE Technical Committee (TC) 1.6, Terminology. TC 1.6 is concerned with terminology, nomenclature, definitions, abbreviations, symbols, and the International System (SI) and Inch-Pound (I-P) units used in the fields of heating, ventilating, air conditioning, water heating, and refrigeration.
